# Semantic-UI Toolkit - Inloco theme

## Installing

```sh
  npm install --save supernova-inloco
  #or
  yarn add supernova-inloco
```

## Contributing

We're using `yarn`'s lockfile, so we'll assume that it's the one being used, but note that `npm` will also work.

### Setup

To setup the project, you just need to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed and run it to install the project's dependencies:

```sh
  yarn
```

### Storybook

We're using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), to easily see and test the components.

Run it with:

```sh
  yarn storybook
```

Then open it at the url indicated on the terminal, probably: `http://localhost:9001/`.
